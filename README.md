Imgs - Clutch.IO Example App
============================

[Imgs](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imgs/id498626072?ls=1&mt=8) is a fun iOS
app built to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the
[Clutch](https://clutch.io/) mobile framework.  It shows the best images on the
internet, as provided by [Imgur](http://imgur.com/), and allows users to
comment on them and like them.  Imgs also uses [Parse](https://parse.com/) as
its storage layer to show how easy integration with modern platforms can be
when using Clutch.
